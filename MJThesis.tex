% Template for a UBC-compliant dissertation
% At the minimum, you will need to change the information found
% after the "Document meta-data"
%
%!TEX TS-program = pdflatex
%!TEX encoding = UTF-8 Unicode

%% The ubcdiss class provides several options:
%%   gpscopy (aka fogscopy)
%%       set parameters to exactly how GPS specifies
%%         * single-sided
%%         * page-numbering starts from title page
%%         * the lists of figures and tables have each entry prefixed
%%           with 'Figure' or 'Table'
%%       This can be tested by `\ifgpscopy ... \else ... \fi'
%%   10pt, 11pt, 12pt
%%       set default font size
%%   oneside, twoside
%%       whether to format for single-sided or double-sided printing
%%   balanced
%%       when double-sided, ensure page content is centred
%%       rather than slightly offset (the default)
%%   singlespacing, onehalfspacing, doublespacing
%%       set default inter-line text spacing; the ubcdiss class
%%       provides \textspacing to revert to this configured spacing
%%   draft
%%       disable more intenssdive processing, such as including
%%       graphics, etc.
