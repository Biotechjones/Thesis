\begin{epigraph}
    \emph{But during the writing of this review, I learned how little I knew in this area, and this was a humbling and sobering experience. I am certain that I have made many mistakes due to my ignorance, and I hope that the review will be useful despite its many faults} ---~Hiroshi Nikaido (2003), my grand supervisor.
