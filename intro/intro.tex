\section{S-layers} \label{sec:intro-slayers}
\subsection{S-layer structure} % (fold)
\label{sub:s_layer_structure} \lettrine[lines=2]{C}{ellular} envelopes are the interface between a
cell and its environment. Many different organsims have evolved extra coatings and membrane
adaptations to enhance or provide new functionality to their cell envelopes. For example, capsules
can enhance the virulence of \textit{Streptococci}\upcite[]{griffith1928significance} and mycolic
acids increase resistance to antibiotics for \textit{Mycobacteria}\upcite[.]{nguyen2006foundations}
One such adaptation widespread in microbially life is the \ac{S-layer}. \Acp{S-layer} are
proteinacious, para-crystalline coatings that surround some bacteria and
archaea\upcite[.]{beveridge1991surface, sara2000s}. A good review on the subject of \ac{S-layer} structure was written by Tea Pavkov-Keller, Stefan Howorka and Walter Keller\upcite[.]{PavkovKeller201173} \Acp{S-layer} are planar, being a thin layer of protein or glycoprotein sitting externally to outer membrane in Gram-negative bacteria, the
peptidoglycan layer in Gram-positive bacteria, and the cell membrane of
archaeabacteria. \Cref{fig:cellwalls} (\vpageref{fig:cellwalls}) diagrams the general,
cross-sectional structure of bacteria and archaea that possess an S-layer.

    positive bacteria, and (\textbf{C}) archaebacteria. In all known cases the \ac{S-layer} sits on
    the extreme outer surface of the cell. (This diagram was inspired by Fig. 1 from
    \fullcite{sleytr1983crystalline})}
  \label{fig:cellwalls}
\end{figure}

\Acp{S-layer} are composed of one or only a few proteins or glycoproteins. In most known examples,
\acp{S-layer} are composed of just one repeated protein, in a few cases \acp{S-layer} are composed
of a few separate proteins. The \ac{S-layer} from \textit{Clostridium difficile} is composed of two
proteins (HMW and LMW) that arise from the cleavage of a single precursor protein (SlpA) that is
cleaved during secretion\upcite[.]{calabi2001difficile, fagan2009difficile} \textit{Bacillus
  anthracis} has a \ac{S-layer} that is composed of two proteins (EA1 and Sap) that are individually
expressed and assemble together on the surface of the bacterium\upcite[.]{mesnage1997molecular}
Interestingly, \textit{Brevibacillus brevis} appears to have two \acp{S-layer} stacked on top of each
other; the outer layer having oblique symmetry and the lower layer having hexagonal
symmetry\upcite[.]{sara1990brevis}
    
For \acp{S-layer} that are composed of a single protein, that protein is repeated thousands of times
across the surface of the cell and is arranged in a regular geometric pattern. The geometric
patterns can be observed by electron microscopy. Smit et\,al.~used the electron microscopy techniques
of freeze fracture and negative stain to visualize the \ac{S-layer} of \ac{caulobacter} for the
first time in 1981\upcite[.]{smit1981periodic} The six major geometric symmetries found in
\acp{S-layer} are oblique (p1 and p2), triangular (p3), rectangular (p4), and hexagonal
(p6). \Cref{fig:symmetries} (\vpageref{fig:symmetries}) features simple examples of the six major
symmetries found in \acp{S-layer}.  Examples of bacteria with oblique \acp{S-layer} are
\textit{Bacillus stearothermophilus} NRS2004$/$3a\upcite{messner1986characterization} and
\textit{Brevibacillus brevis}\upcite[.]{masuda1980reassembly} Examples of bacteria with rectangular
\acp{S-layer} are \textit{Corynebacterium diptheriae}e\upcite{kawata1972extracellular} and
\textit{Aeromonas salmonicidae} A450\upcite[.]{ishiguro1981loss} An example of a bacterium with a
triangular \ac{S-layer} is \textit{Sulfolobus acidocaldarius}\upcite[.]{weiss1974subunit} Examples
of bacteria with hexagonal \acp{S-layer} are \textit{Bacillus anthracis}\upcite{holt1969comparative}
and \textit{Caulobacter crescentus} CB15\upcite[.]{smit1981periodic}

In addition to the traditional transmission electron microscopy techniques that have been used to
visualize bacterial cell surfaces in the past, a new method of cryo-electron tomography has been
used recently to observe and dissect bacterial cells. Cryo-electron tomography has the advantage
that it be used to observe unfixed and unstained intact cells. Being a tomographical technique cross
sections can be reconstructed to observe the fine structure within and on a bacterial cell. No
deliberate study has been taken to use cryo-electron tomography to study \acp{S-layer}, but their
presence is easily observed in the fantastic images produced by other studies utilizing the
technique. This technique has been pioneered for use in bacteria and specifically in \ac{caulobacter} by the laboratory of Dr.\,Grant Jensen at the California Institute of Technology. \Cref{fig:intro-tomo} (\vpageref{fig:intro-tomo}) features a tomographical cross-section of a \ac{caulobacter} cell; visible is the inner and outer membranes and the \ac{S-layer} composed of the protein RsaA.

\subsection{S-layer Proteins} \label{sub:intro-slayerproteins} % S-layer protein subsection

Discussing \ac{S-layer} proteins on a whole can be difficult because \ac{S-layer} proteins don't represent a monophyletic group of related molecules; \ac{S-layer} proteins seem to be distinctly unrelated proteins that share a common cellular location and gross structure through convergent evolution. One of the best reviews on \ac{S-layer} proteins was published in 2000 by Margit S\'{a}ra and Uwe B. Sleytr\upcite[.]{sara2000s} 

\ac{S-layer} proteins do tend to share similar properties and overall composition. \ac{S-layer} proteins are large proteins. For the \ac{S-layer} proteins whose sequences are known, all are larger than 400 \ac{aa} and many of them larger than 1000 \ac{aa}\upcite[.]{sara2000s} The amino acids in \ac{S-layer} proteins are rich in hydrophobic and negatively charged residues, low in methionines, and  cysteines are almost completely unrepresented\upcite[.]{gilchrist1992nucleotide, sara2000s, vilen2009surface}  

\ac{S-layer} proteins are almost universally glycosylated in \textit{Archaeabacteria}, commonly
glycosylated in Gram-positive bacteria, and very rarely glycosylated in Gram-negative
bacteria\upcite[.]{sara2000s, lechner1989structure}

For some microbes, the \ac{S-layer}'s main function maybe as a platform for oligo/polysaccharide chains. One study by Sch\"{a}ffer et\,al.~asked the question about the glycosylation of \ac{S-layer} proteins, ``Are \ac{S-layer} Glycoproteins and Lipopolysaccharide Related?''\upcite[]{schaffer1996s} The study identified structural similarities between the carbohydrates in \ac{OPS} and the carbohydrates on glycosylated \ac{S-layer} proteins; pointing out they have more in common with each other than with eukaryotic polysaccharides. The study makes great leaps from sugar structures to phylogenetic and taxonomic conclusions, but the study does highlight that supporting a highly glycosylated surface is a widespread feature in microbially life and it is a role that \ac{S-layer} proteins serve in some organisms.

\subsection{RsaA} \label{sec:intro-rsaa}

 RsaA is a 1026 \ac{aa} protein with an average \ac{mw} of 98001.70 Da and a \ac{pi} of 3.85. The sequence of RsaA can be found in the appendix on \cpageref{app:rsaseq}.

\paragraph{Type 1 secretion} RsaA is secreted by a \ac{t1ss}. \Ac{t1ss} secreted proteins are secreted in one step across both the inner and outer membranes of Gram-negative bacteria. A \ac{t1ss} requires three components: an inner membrane spanning \ac{abc} transporter, a periplasm spanning membrane fusion protein, and an outer membrane protein. For RsaA's secretion from \caulobacter, these proteins are RsaD, RsaE, and RsaF (either RsaFa or RsaFb). Like all \ac{t1ss} secreted proteins, RsaA is secreted starting from the C-terminus to the N-terminus. As proteins are translated from the N-terminus to the C-terminus, all \ac{t1ss} secreted proteins (including RsaA) exist in the cytoplasm as fully translated polypeptides prior to secretion. This is in contrast to protein secreted by N-terminus first means, which allow for the possibility for secretion to begin on a nascent peptide before translation is complete. The diameter of \ac{t1ss} pore is not wide enough to accommodate the secretion of a fully folded protein, so \ac{t1ss} secreted proteins often have a C-terminus that is intrinsically disordered prior to secretion; this disordered state is mediated by \ac{rtx} motifs\upcite[.]{chenal2009rtx}   

% TODO add citations to above paragraph

    \paragraph{Repeat-in-toxin motifs} First identified in the \ecoli protein $\alpha$-haemolysin (HlyA) in 19**, \ac{rtx} motifs are a nearly ubiquitous component of \ac{t1ss} secreted proteins. Despite the name, \acl{rtx} aren't exclusively found in toxins, they are found in many classes of protein, lipases, proteases, S-layers,\textit{etc.}  \ac{rtx} motifs are small peptide sequences, typically 6--9 \ac{aa} in length:\texttt{GGXGXD}\upcite[]{letoffe1992secretion} or \texttt{GGXGXDXLX}(where \texttt{G} is glycine, \texttt{D} is aspartate, \texttt{X} can be any amino acid, and \texttt{L} is leucine but is often substituted for valine, isoleucine, phenylalanine, or tyrosine)\upcite[.]{rose1995interaction, chenal2009rtx} The short sequences are always present in multiples (6--50+), often found in tandem repeats. Each \ac{rtx} motif forms two half sites for binding \ce{Ca^2+}, which can collaborate with other neighbouring \ac{rtx} sites to coordinate ions and stabilize a connection between disparate regions of a protein. Upon binding \ce{Ca^2+}, \ac{rtx} motifs assume a parallel $\beta$-roll fold\upcite[,]{meier2007calcium} rolling around \ce{Ca^2+} ions at the turns. An example of a \ac{rtx} $\beta$-roll structure can be found in \cref{fig:intro-rtx}. The reported \ac{kd} of \ac{rtx} sites is 0.5--0.8 \millimolar\upcite[.]{rose1995interaction}

The blue spheres are calcium ions coordinated by aspartate residues which are shown. This structure is of MIS38, an extracellular lipase from \ac{pseudomonas} (PDB:2Z8X). The structure here depicts five \ac{rtx} sites binding five \ce{Ca^2+} ions, RsaA from \caulobacter also has five \ac{rtx} motifs in close vicinity and my have a similar structure the presented structure above. See the sequence of RsaA on \cpageref{app:rsaseq}, \ac{rtx} sequences are bolded. Generated using the program \texttt{Chimera} (\fullcite{pettersen2004ucsf}).

   	\label{fig:intro-rtx}
\end{figure}   

It is thought that the roles of \ac{rtx} motifs in \ac{t1ss} proteins are to induce an intrinsically disorder C-terminus prior to secretion and to quickly  bind \ce{Ca^2+} and begin folding once the protein has started to emerge from the secretion machinery\upcite[.]{perez2010characterization, sotomayor2014disorder} The calcium-induced folding may help the thermodynamics of secretion, possibly assisting by pulling the protein out of the pore.
