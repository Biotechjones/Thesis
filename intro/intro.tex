    \begin{epigraph}
            \emph{``But during the writing of this review, I learned how little I knew in this area, and this was a humbling and sobering experience. I am certain that I have made many mistakes due to my ignorance, rnd I hope that the review will be useful despite its many faults''}---~Hiroshi Nikaido (2003), my grand supervisor.

                \caption[Cross-sectional diagrams of \ac{S-layer} containing cell envelopes]{Cross-sectional diagrams of the cell envelopes of (\textbf{A}) Gram negative bacteria, (\textbf{B}) Gram positive bacteria, and (\textbf{C}) archaebacteria. In all known cases the \ac{S-layer} sits on the extreme outer surface of the cell. (This diagram was inspired by Fig. 1 from \fullcite{sleytr1983crystalline})}

            Examples of bacteria with oblique \acs{S-layer} are \textit{Bacillus stearothermophilus} NRS2004$/$3a\upcite{messner1986characterization} and \textit{Lactobacillus brevis}\upcite[.]{masuda1980reassembly}
            Examples of bacteria with rectangular \acs{S-layer} are \textit{Corynebacterium diphtheriae}e\upcite{kawata1972extracellular} and \textit{Aeromonas salmonicidae} A450\upcite[.]{ishiguro1981loss}
            An example of a bacterium with a triangular \ac{S-layer} is \textit{Sulfolobus acidocaldarius}\upcite[.]{weiss1974subunit}
            Examples of bacteria with hexagonal \acs{S-layer} are
            \textit{Bacillus
            anthracis}\upcite{holt1969comparative} and
            \textit{Caulobacter crescentus} CB15\upcite[.]{smit1981periodic}

                p4 is a rectangular symmetry.  
                p3  is a triangular symmetry. 
                p6 is a hexagonal symmetry.}

The hexagonal \ac{S-layer} on the surface of the bacterium --- probably \textit{Spirillum} sp. --- is visible along the edges of the cell body (centre right). The scale bar denotes one micrometre.
