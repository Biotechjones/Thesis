\begin{epigraph}
    \emph{But during the writing of this review, I learned how little I knew in this area, and this was a humbling and sobering experience. I am certain that I have made many mistakes due to my ignorance, and I hope that the review will be useful despite its many faults} ---~Hiroshi Nikaido (2003), my grand supervisor.

            \caption[The first published image of a \ac{S-layer}.]{The first published image of a \ac{S-layer}. The hexagonal \ac{S-layer} on the surface of the bacterium --- probably \textit{Spirillum} sp. --- is visible along the edges of the cell body (centre right). The scale bar denotes one micrometre. (This image is Fig. 1 from \fullcite{firstslayer} )}

        \caption[Cross-sectional diagrams of the cell envelopes]{Cross-sectional diagrams of the cell envelopes of (\textbf{A}) Gram negative bacteria, (\textbf{B}) Gram positive bacteria, and (\textbf{C}) archaebacteria. In all known cases the \ac{S-layer} sits on the extreme outer surface of the cell. (This diagram was inspired by Fig. 1 from \fullcite{sleytr1983crystalline})}
