The lipid A structure has been reported\\upcite[;]{caulobacterlipida} it is a unique molecule containing a di-diaminoglucose backbone (instead of di-glucosamine) and two galacturonate moieties that replace the canonical phosphates that are on each end of the disaccharide in most lipid A molecules. The \\caulobacter \\ac{S-layer} non-covalently attaches to the \\ac{OPS}\\upcite[.]{walker94} However, the \\ac{OPS} structure has not been resolved. Genetic analyses have pointed towards the unusual N-acetylperosamine being a major component\\upcite[.]{awramgenes} A notable feature of this O-antigen is that it exists completely hidden beneath the S-layer, presumably inaccessible to the environment\\upcite[.]{walker94} Carbohydrate structures from non-pathogenic bacterial \\ac{LPS} are rarely studied and an \\ac{LPS} that is sequestered beneath an \\ac{S-layer} is not represented in the literature.\n\n	In the present study our data has determined the core \\ac{OS} structure from \\caulobacter CB15 NA1000 (advancing an earlier report of core composition\\upcite{ravenscroftlps}), as well as the central backbone and non-reducing ends of its \\ac{OPS}. Unexpectedly, we identified a previously unknown rhamnan polysaccharide. Along with previous reports on lipid A\\upcite{caulobacterlipida} and \\ac{EPS}\\upcite[,]{ravenscrofteps} we believe that all the major carbohydrate structures in \\caulobacter cell envelope have now been solved.\n% section introduction (end)\n\n\\section{Results} % (fold)\n\\label{sec:results}\n	\\subsection{Characterisation of whole \\textsc{lps}} % (fold)\n	\\label{sub:characterisation_of_whole_lps}\n		%% %^Write\n		\\begin{figure}[htb]\n			\\begin{center}\n				\\includegraphics[width=0.3\\textwidth]{lps_chapter/img/lpssilverstain.jpg}\n			\\end{center}\n			\\caption[Visual comparison of \\ecoli O122 \\ac{LPS} and \\caulobacter \\ac{LPS}]{Visual comparison of silver stained \\ecoli O122 \\ac{LPS} and \\caulobacter \\ac{LPS}. \\ac{LPS} samples were run on a \\ac{SDS-PAGE} and silver stained.

It was obviously not a regular polymer with well-defined repeating units. Attempts to separate this material by anion-exchange chromatography led to the isolation of a number of fractions from neutral to slightly retained, but all of them had virtually identical \\ac{NMR} spectra. Methylation of the polysaccharide led to the identification of 3- and 3,4-substituted mannopyranose, terminal glucopyranose (derived from side-chain 3-O-MeGlc), terminal, 3-, 4-, and 2,4-substituted rhamnopyranose, 3-substituted PerNAc, and an unidentified derivative resembling methylated PerN that eluted between dimethylhexose derivatives and 3-substituted PerNAc. To identify the position of the methyl groups in naturally methylated monosaccharides, methylation was conducted with \\ce{CD3I}. This confirmed the identification of tetramethylglucitol as originating from 3-O-MeGlc, but did not identify any other naturally methylated monosaccharides, visible in \\ac{NMR} spectra. An unknown derivative received two deuterated methyl groups.\n\n		\\begin{figure}[ph]  %% 1D NMR Spectra\n			\\begin{center}\n				\\includegraphics[height=0.9\\textheight]{lps_chapter/img/lpsfig1.pdf}\n			\\end{center}\n			\\caption[\\textsuperscript{1}H \\ac{NMR} spectra of \\caulobacter{} \\ac{OPS}]{\\textsuperscript{1}H \\ac{NMR} spectra of the intact \\caulobacter{} \\ac{OPS}  (bottom trace), double oxidized polysaccharide (middle trace) and N-deacylated double oxidized polysaccharide (upper trace).}\n			\\label{fig:lpsfig1}\n		\\end{figure}\n	% subsection initial_assessment_and_component_analysis (end)\n\n	\\subsection{O-antigen structure determination (\\textsc{ps}1)} % (fold)\n	\\label{sub:o_antigen_structure_determination_ps1_}\n\n		A set of 2D spectra [\\ac{gCOSY}, \\ac{TOCSY}, \\ac{NOESY}, \\textsuperscript{1}H-\\textsuperscript{13}C \\ac{gHSQC}, \\ac{gHMBC}] was obtained for the \\ac{PS}. There were many (more than 20) lines of correlations from the anomeric signals. Later, after the analysis of \\ac{PS} degradation products, most of them could be assigned to particular structures (\\cref{fig:lpsops,fig:lpsends,fig:lpsrhamnan}). Polysaccharide heterogeneity was not caused by random acetylation, but \\ac{PS} contained 4 methyl groups (one major and 3 minor). Monosaccharide analysis revealed L-Rha, D-Man, D-PerN (perosamine, 4-aminodeoxyrhamnose), and 3-O-MeGlc. Other methylated monosaccharides were not identified by \\ac{GC-MS} as alditol acetates, possibly due to low content or degradation during hydrolysis. The \\ac{GC-MS} data is presented in \\cref{fig:monosaccharide_analysis}.\n\n		\\begin{figure}[htb]  %% monosaccharides\n			\\begin{center}\n				\\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth]{lps_chapter/img/lps_monosaccharides.pdf}\n			\\end{center}\n			\\caption[Monosaccharide analysis of \\ac{LPS}]{Monosaccharide analysis of \\caulobacter\\ \\ac{LPS}. Alditol acetates derivatives of the \\ac{LPS} component monosaccharides were separated and identified by \\ac{GC-MS}. The protocol used is described on \\cpageref{sub:monosaccharide_analysis}.}\n			\\label{fig:monosaccharide_analysis}\n		\\end{figure}\n\n		In an attempt to simplify the structure, \\ac{PS} was oxidized with \\ce{NaIO4}, reduced with \\ce{NaBD4}, hydrolysed with 2\\% \\ce{AcOH}, and the products were separated on a Biogel P6 column to give a polymer and an \\ac{OS}, \\ac{OS}1. Analysis of \\ac{OS}1 will be described below. For some reason not all of the rhamnan was oxidized, and some of its signals persisted in the spectra of the remaining polymer (without side-chain Rha F). To remove the rest of it, the oxidation was repeated to produce \\ac{PS}1. Spectra still contained some signals of minor components, analysed later. Assignment of the spectra of the non-oxidisable polymer \\ac{PS}1 was difficult due to complete or partial overlap of the H-2,3,4,5 signals of PerNAc. To improve signal spread, \\ac{PS}1 was deacylated with 4 M \\ce{NaOH}. At this point the major polymer became positively charged and an attempt was made to separate it from the minor components using cation-exchange chromatography. However, all material was eluted together at high salt concentration, thus indicating that all components were chemically bound together. Assignment of the spectra (\\cref{fig:lps2dnmr}, \\cref{tbl:lpsops}) became possible at this stage due to better signal spread (H-4 signals of PerN moved to high field due to deacylation) and the sequence shown on \\cref{fig:lpsops} was proposed. Spectra contained the signals of two $\\beta$-mannopyranose, $\\alpha$-3-O-MeGlc, and two -Per4N. The following interresidual \\ac{NOE} and \\ac{HMBC} correlations were used to determine the sequence: R1:L3, L1:Z3, Z1:Q3, Q1:W3, W1:X3, A1:X4. \\Ac{PS}1 had trisaccharide repeating units composed of $\\beta$-mannose and two $\\alpha$-PerNAc residues, and every second repeating unit carried a side branch of 3-O-MeGlc. It seems that side-chains were present quite regularly at each second trisaccharide repeat of the main chain, because \\ac{NOE} correlations were observed between the repeating units with and without 3-O-MeGlc, and not between units of the same structure. Thus altogether, the repeating unit contained seven monosaccharides.\n\n		\\begin{figure}[H]\n			\\begin{center}\n				\\includegraphics[]{lps_chapter/img/lpsops.pdf}\n			\\end{center}\n			\\caption[The structure of the \\caulobacter \\ac{OPS}.]{The structure of the \\caulobacter \\ac{OPS}. \\textbf{A.} The intact repeating unit, \\ac{PS}1. \\textbf{B.} The deacylated product of \\ac{PS}1.}\n			\\label{fig:lpsops}\n		\\end{figure}\n\n		\\begin{figure}[H]\n			\\begin{center}\n				\\includegraphics[width=0.9\\textwidth]{lps_chapter/img/lpsfig3.pdf}\n			\\end{center}\n			\\caption[2D \\ac{NMR} of \\caulobacter{} \\ac{PS}1.]{Overlap of \\ac{COSY} (green), \\ac{TOCSY} (red) and \\ac{ROESY} (black) correlations from anomeric protons of double oxidized deacylated \\caulobacter{} \\ac{PS}1.}\n			\\label{fig:lps2dnmr}\n		\\end{figure}\n\n		\\begin{table}[h]  % LPS OPS\n			\\centering\n			\\caption{\\Ac{NMR} data for \\caulobacter \\ac{PS}1 (40\\cel) and deacylated \\ac{PS}1 (50\\cel).

They probably represented the non-reducing ends of the major chain, \\ac{PS}1 (\\cref{fig:lpsends}). The minor components contained methylated Rha (2-O-Me-Rha residue J and 2,3-Me$_2$-PerN residue B). The position of the methyl groups were found from \\ac{HMBC} correlations between protons of methyl groups and carbon atoms bearing OMe groups, which all were well visible and did not overlap with other signals due to their low field position. Thus, two independent structural fragments, 1 and 2, were found and are shown in \\cref{fig:lpsends}. Mannose residues Z' and Z\" at the non-reducing ends of these fragments were further linked to PerN residues, indistinguishable from the PerN of the main chain. PerN residue D had upfield shifted C-2 and downfield shifted C-3 signals (\\cref{tbl:lpsends})), which have not been explained. It appears that its O-3 was phosphorylated, producing typical phosphorylation signal shifts and broadening of the H-3 signal, but \\textsuperscript{1}H-\\textsuperscript{31}P \\ac{HMQC} \\ac{NMR} spectrum showed no signals, possibly due to the low abundance of this residue. Possibly Rha residues inserted in the structure resembling \\ac{PS}1 represented the attachment point of the rhamnan (\\ac{PS}2) to \\ac{PS}1, if they were linked together.\n\n		 \\begin{figure}[htb]\n		 	\\begin{center}\n		 		\\includegraphics[]{lps_chapter/img/lpsends.pdf}\n		 	\\end{center}\n		 	\\caption[The structure of minor component, the end caps of the \\ac{OPS}.]{The structure of minor component, the end caps of the \\ac{OPS}. \\textbf{A.} Fragment 1. \\textbf{B.} Fragment 2.}\n		 	\\label{fig:lpsends}\n		 \\end{figure}\n\n		 \\begin{table}[htb]\n			 \\centering\n			 \\caption[\\Ac{NMR} data for the minor components of the double oxidized non-deacylated \\ac{PS}]{\\ac{NMR} data for the minor components of the double oxidized non-deacylated \\ac{PS} (50\\cel).

Presented data show structures of the core part, two polymers, and putative terminal structures. The polysaccharides could not be separated by size exclusion or anion-exchange chromatography and are probably linked together through the same core. The core of the \\caulobacter{} \\ac{LPS} has been studied previously and an initial assessment of its composition was made\\upcite[,]{ravenscroftlps} but the complete structure had not been determined. The structure of the \\ac{OPS} has not been studied before. In our view the polysaccharide structure of the \\caulobacter{} \\ac{LPS} represents one of the most complicated bacterial \\ac{LPS} polysaccharide structures identified so far.\n\n	The Kdo present in the \\ac{LPS} core structure (see \\cref{fig:lpscore}) has the typical substitutions at O-4 and O-5 of a manno-configured sugar and a negatively charged sugar, respectively\\upcite[.]{brade99} It also has a rarely observed third substitution at O-7 with a heptose moiety. The Kdo O-7 position is known to be occupied by a galactose moiety in the core of \\textit{Rhizobium leguminosarum} bv. Viciae VF39\\upcite[,]{rhizobiumlps} and the secondary Kdo in the core oligosaccharide from \\textit{Acinetobacter baumannii} ATCC 19606 has an O-7 substituted with a glucosamine\\upcite[.]{acinetobacterlps}\n\n	In the traditional model \\ac{LPS} occupies the outer leaflet of the outer membrane of a Gram-negative bacterium, and so (excepting the presence of cell associated \\ac{EPS}) is the outermost layer of the cell. For \\caulobacter, however, \\ac{LPS} is the penultimate barrier below the protein \\ac{S-layer}. The \\caulobacter{} \\ac{OPS} serves as the anchor for the S-layer and is likely not accessible to the environment\\upcite[.]{walker94} The carbohydrates found in the \\ac{OPS} are particularly hydrophobic, marked by the abundance of deoxy-sugars, acetyl groups, and methyl groups. This hydrophobicity is possibly a result of particular sugars needed for \\ac{S-layer} anchoring, as these carbohydrate structures likely evolved as the cognate ligands for the \\ac{S-layer} protein, RsaA. The distance between the \\ac{S-layer} and the outer membrane is about 17--19 nm\\upcite[.]{dipm} It is possible the hydrophobicity aids in packing the polysaccharides between the S-layer and the \\ac{LPS}. Further determination of RsaA's structure should help illuminate the interaction between the S-layer and \\ac{OPS}.\n\n	Knowledge of the structure of \\caulobacter{} \\ac{OPS} and \\ac{LPS} will facilitate the determination and characterization of their biosynthetic enzymes and mutant variants. Already, the enzymes LpxI\\upcite{lpxi} and GDP-L-perosamine acetylase\\upcite{perosmineacetyltransferase} from \\caulobacter have been characterized. One uncharacterised enzyme, WbqL, is necessary for proper \\ac{OPS} synthesis and disruption of wbqL leads to the accumulation of truncated and S-layer anchoring deficient \\ac{OPS} in the inner membrane and inhibits Crescentin-mediated cell curvature\\upcite[.]{lpsinterferecrescentin} Many genes, such as wbqL, have been identified as essential for \\ac{OPS} synthesis\\upcite{awramgenes} but have not yet been characterized. Other genes, that must be essential for \\ac{OPS} synthesis, have yet to be identified or characterized, such as the O-antigen polymerase and ligase.\n\n	% --Should I increase the text about lpxI?--%\n\n	The subunit-based repeating nature of \\caulobacter{} \\ac{OPS} suggests that a Wzy-dependent pathway synthesizes the polymer\\upcite[.]{lpsreview02} The previous study that aimed to identify genes essential for \\ac{OPS} did not identify many of the canonical genes in the Wzy-dependant pathway\\upcite[,]{awramgenes} such as the O-unit transporter, Wzx, O-antigen polymerase, Wzy; the chain-length determinate protein, Wzz; and the O-antigen ligase, WaaL. Genes that have been annotated as putative O-antigen synthesis genes do appear in the sequenced genomes for \\caulobacter CB15, but they have not been experimentally confirmed. \n\n	An additional aspect to this \\ac{LPS} it the fact that its O-antigen is of homogeneous length. While other \\ac{LPS}s vary in size due to the number of O-antigen repeat groups, appearing as a laddering of bands by \\ac{SDS-PAGE}, the \\ac{LPS} from \\caulobacter appears as a single band\\upcite[.]{walker94} Initial \\ac{MALDI-TOF} analysis of the entire \\ac{LPS} indicates a size of about 10.8 kDa (see \\cref{fig:lpsmalditof} on \\cpageref{fig:lpsmalditof}).\n	After accounting for the solved structures for the lipid A and core regions, this suggests the \\ac{LPS} contains approximately 5 repeats of the proposed heptameric O-antigen structure.  There is not currently a known mechanism for the regulation and synthesis of a strictly homogeneous length O-antigen. It is possible that this \\ac{OPS} is synthesized via the \\ac{ABC}-transporter-dependent pathway\\upcite{lpsreview02} or another heretofore undiscovered mechanism. In any event it would seem that the transfer of a polysaccharide of this considerable size to the outer leaflet of the outer membrane is a remarkable feat for the bacterium.\n \n",
