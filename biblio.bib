   abstract = {Caulobacters are adherent prosthecate bacteria that are members of bacterial biofouling communities in many environments. Investigation of the cell surface carbohydrates produced by two strains of the freshwater Caulobacter crescentus, CB2A and CB15A, revealed a hitherto undetected extracellular polysaccharide (EPS) or capsule. Isolation and characterization of the EPS fractions showed that each strain produced a unique neutral EPS which could not be readily removed from the cell surface by washing. Monosaccharide analysis showed that the main CB2A EPS contained D-glucose, D-gulose, and D-fucose in a ratio of 3:1:1, whereas the CB15A EPS fraction contained D-galactose, D-glucose, D-mannose, and D-fucose in approximately equal amounts. Methylation analysis of the main CB2A EPS showed the presence of terminal glucose and gulose groups, 3-linked fucosyl, and two 3,4-linked glucosyl units, thus confirming the pentasaccharide repeating unit indicated by 1H nuclear magnetic resonance analysis. Similar studies of the CB15A EPS revealed a tetrasaccharide repeating unit consisting of terminal galactose, 4-linked fucosyl, 3-linked glucosyl, and 3,4-linked mannosyl residues. EPS was not detectable by thin-section electron microscopy techniques, including some methods designed to preserve or enhance capsules, nor was the EPS readily detected on the cell surface by scanning electron microscopy when conventional fixation techniques were used; however, a structure consistent with EPS was revealed when samples were prepared by cryofixation and freeze-substitution methods.},

Two distinct strains of the species, NA 1000 and CB2A, were examined; despite differences in other membrane-related polysaccharides, the two gave similar LPS composition profiles. The LPS was the equivalent of the rough LPS described for other bacteria in that it lacked the ladder of polysaccharide-containing species that results from addition of variable amounts of a repeated sequence of sugars, as detected by gel electrophoresis in smooth LPS strains. The purified LPS contained two definable regions: (i) an oligosaccharide region, consisting of an inner core of three residues of 2-keto-3-deoxyoctonate, two residues of alpha-L-glycero-D-mannoheptose, and one alpha-D-glycero-D-mannoheptose unit and an outer core region containing one residue each of alpha-D-mannose, alpha-D-galactose, and alpha-D-glucose, with the glucose likely phosphorylated and (ii) a region equivalent to the lipid A region of the archetype, consisting primarily of an esterified fatty acid, 3-OH-dodecanoate. The lipid A-like region was resistant to conclusive analysis; in particular, although a variety of analytical methods were used, no amino sugars were detected, as is found in the lipid A of the LPS of most bacteria.},

(strain VF-39) and two symbiotically defective Tn5 mutants (VF-39-32 and VF-39-86) have been studied. The LPS of the mutants reflected impaired synthesis of the O-antigen. In the LPS of one mutant, the core tetrasaccharide was lacking and in that of the other it was truncated to a disaccharide containing mannose and 3-deoxy-D-manno-oct-2-ulosonic acid (KdO). The latter mutant also synthesized an unusual carbohydrate component containing mannose, galactose, and an unidentified saccharide. The lipid A composition was similar to that found in other strains of R. leguminosarum biovar viciae. The O-antigen of the wild-type bacterium contained 2-O-methylfucose, fucose, 3,6-dideoxy-3(methylamino)hexose, glucose, 2-amino-2,6-dideoxyhexose, and heptose. This study clearly defines a role for the bacterial LPS in the proper functioning of the Rhizobium legume symbiosis.},

   abstract = {Argininemia is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by a deficiency in the liver-type arginase enzyme. Clinical manifestations include progressive spastic diplegia and mental retardation. While the quality of life can severely deteriorate in most such patients, some do show remarkable improvement in neurological symptoms while on controlled diets. We examined the thesis that differences in clinical responses to dietary treatment are based on molecular heterogeneity in mutant arginase alleles. Genomic DNAs from 11 patients with argininemia were examined using the polymerase chain reaction, cloning, and sequencing. Nine mutations representing 21/22 mutant alleles were identified in 11 patients with argininemia, and four of these mutations were expressed in vitro to determine the severity of enzymatic defects. We found that these mutations accounted for 64% of the mutant alleles in our patients. Based on findings in vitro expression tests, the mutations can be considered either severe or moderate. Patients with at least one moderate mutant allele responded well to dietary treatment; concentrations of plasma arginine were controlled within 300 mu M. In contrast, patients with two severely mutated alleles did not respond to dietary treatment and plasma arginine was over 400 mu M. Argininemia is heterogeneous at the molecular level. The degree of clinical improvement during dietary treatment is reflected in the concentration of arginine in plasma, as a measure of metabolic control. Plasma arginine levels during treatment is reflected in the concentration of arginine in plasma, as a measure of metabolic control. Plasma arginine levels during treatment correlated with types of molecular defects in the arginase genes.},

   abstract = {Caulobacter crescentus is a gram-negative bacterium that produces a two-dimensional crystalline array on its surface composed of a single 98-kDa protein, RsaA. Secretion of RsaA to the cell surface relies on an uncleaved C-terminal secretion signal. In this report, we identify two genes encoding components of the RsaA secretion apparatus. These components are part of a type I secretion system involving an ABC transporter protein. These genes, lying immediately 3' of rsaA, were found by screening a Tn5 transposon library for the loss of RsaA transport and characterizing the transposon-interrupted genes. The two proteins presumably encoded by these genes were found to have significant sequence similarity to ABC transporter and membrane fusion proteins of other type I secretion systems. The greatest sequence similarity was found to the alkaline protease (AprA) transport system of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the metalloprotease (PrtB) transport system of Erwinia chrysanthemi. The prtB and aprA genes were introduced into C. crescentus, and their products were secreted by the RsaA transport system. Further, defects in the S-layer protein transport system led to the loss of this heterologous secretion. This is the first report of an S-layer protein secreted by a type I secretion apparatus. Unlike other type I secretion systems, the RsaA transport system secretes large amounts of its substrate protein (it is estimated that RsaA accounts for 10 to 12% of the total cell protein). Such levels are expected for bacterial S-layer proteins but are higher than for any other known type I secretion system.},

   abstract = {The outer surface of Caulobacter crescentus consists of a two-dimensional crystalline protein lattice layer (S-layer). A fraction of the LPS has an O antigen polymer attached to the core to form a 'smooth' LPS (S-LPS), which is required for attachment of the protein S-layer to the outer-membrane surface. A method to screen for strains defective in LPS production, based on loss of S-layer attachment, was developed and applied to libraries of transposon-generated mutants. Eighteen distinct insertions were found with transposon interruptions in genes affecting S-LPS production, 12 of which were located near the S-layer subunit protein gene, rsaA, and its transporter genes. Sequence adjacent to transposon insertion points was determined and used to search a C. crescentus genome database. Twelve ORFs likely to be involved in S-LPS synthesis were identified. Seven of the predicted ORFs were linked to rsaA. Six of the putative genes had identity with proteins involved in synthesis of sugar residues, including five predicted to make perosamine. The remaining six ORFs were similar to glycosyltransferases involved in forming linkages between sugar residues in the O antigen, while one may be a transcription repressor. Other chemical and preliminary proton NMR studies of the S-LPS O antigen indicate that it contains an N-acetylated 4,6-dideoxy-4-aminohexose, but is not assembled as a simple, uniform homopolymer, consisting of several different linkages between sugar residues. The ORFs described here include homologues of all the enzymes involved in the synthesis of N-acetylperosamine, a 4,6-dideoxy-4-aminohexose. Overall, the data are consistent with the hypothesis that the O antigen of C. crescentus S-LPS consists primarily of N-acetylperosamine residues polymerized with multiple anomeric linkages.},

   abstract = {Bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) typically consist of a hydrophobic domain known as lipid A (or endotoxin), a nonrepeating "core" oligosaccharide, and a distal polysaccharide (or C-antigen). Recent genomic data have facilitated study of LPS assembly in diverse Gram-negative bacteria, many of which are human or plant pathogens, and have established the importance of lateral gene transfer in generating structural diversity of O-antigens. Many enzymes of lipid A biosynthesis like LpxC have been validated as targets for development of new antibiotics. Key genes for lipid A biosynthesis have unexpectedly also been found in higher plants, indicating that eukaryotic lipid A-like molecules may exist. Most significant has been the identification of the plasma membrane protein TLR4 as the lipid A signaling receptor of animal cells. TLR4 belongs to a family of innate immunity receptors that possess a large extracellular domain of leucine-rich repeats, a single trans-membrane segment, and a smaller cytoplasmic signaling region that engages the adaptor protein MyD88. The expanding knowledge of TLR4 specificity and its downstream signaling pathways should provide new opportunities for blocking inflammation associated with infection.},

   abstract = {Strains of Caulobacter crescentus elaborate an S-layer, a two-dimensional protein latticework which covers the cell surface. The S-layer protein (RsaA) is secreted by a type I mechanism (relying on a C-terminal signal) and is unusual among type I secreted proteins because high levels of protein are produced continuously. In efforts to adapt the S-layer for display of foreign peptides and proteins, we noted a proteolytic activity that affected S-layer monomers with foreign inserts. The cleavage was precise, resulting in fragments with an unambiguous N-terminal sequence. We developed an assay to screen for loss of this activity (i.e., presentation of foreign peptides without degradation), using transposon and traditional mutagenesis. A metalloprotease gene designated sap (S-layer-associated protease) was identified which could complement the protease-negative mutants. The N-terminal half of Sap possessed significant similarity to other type I secreted proteases (e.g., alkaline protease of Pseudomonas aeruginosa), including the characteristic RTX repeat sequences, but the C-terminal half which normally includes the type I secretion signal exhibited no such similarity. Instead, there was a region of significant similarity to the N-terminal region of RsaA. We hypothesize that Sap evolved by combining the catalytic portion of a type I secreted protease with an S-layer-like protein, perhaps to associate with nascent S-layer monomers to "scan" for modifications.},

   abstract = {Our freshwater caulobacter collection contains about 40 strains that are morphologically similar to Caulobacter crescentus. All elaborate a crystalline protein surface (S) layer made up of protein monomers 100-193 kDa in size. We conducted a comparative study of S-layer secretion in 6 strains representing 3 size groups of S-layer proteins: small (100-108 kDa), medium (122-151 kDa), and large (181-193 kDa). All contained genes predicted to encode ATP-binding cassette transporters and membrane fusion proteins highly similar to those of C. crescentus, indicating that the S-layer proteins were all secreted by a type I system. The S-layer proteins' C-termini showed unexpectedly low sequence similarity but contained conserved residues and predicted secondary structure features typical of type I secretion signals. Cross-expression studies showed that the 6 strains recognized secretion signals from C. crescentus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and similarly that C. crescentus was able to secrete the S-layer protein C-terminus of 1 strain examined. Inactivation of the ATP-binding cassette transporter abolished S-layer protein secretion, indicating that the type I transporter is necessary for S-layer protein secretion. Finally, while all of the S-layer proteins of this subset of strains were secreted by type I mechanisms, there were significant differences in genome positions of the transporter genes that correlated with S-layer protein size.},

   abstract = {Transport of RsaA, the crystalline S-layer subunit protein of Caulobacter crescentus, is mediated by a type I secretion mechanism. Two proteins have been identified that play the role of the outer membrane protein (OMP) component in the RsaA secretion machinery. The genes rsaF(a) and rsaF(b) were identified by similarity to the Escherichia coli hemolysin secretion OMP TolC by using the C. crescentus genome sequence. The rsaF(a) gene is located several kilobases downstream of the other transporter genes, while rsaF(b) is completely unlinked. An rsaF(a) knockout had approximately 56% secretion compared to wild-type levels, while the rsaF(b) knockout reduced secretion levels to approximately 79%. When expression of both proteins was eliminated, there was no RsaA secretion, but a residual level of approximately 9% remained inside the cell, suggesting posttranslational autoregulation. Complementation with either of the individual rsaF genes by use of a multicopy vector, which resulted in 8- to 10-fold overexpression of the proteins, did not restore RsaA secretion to wild-type levels, indicating that both rsaF genes were required for full-level secretion. However, overexpression of rsaF(a) (with normal rsaF(b) levels) in concert with overexpression of rsaA resulted in a 28% increase in RsaA secretion, indicating a potential for significantly increasing expression levels of an already highly expressing type I secretion system. This is the only known example of type I secretion requiring two OMPs to assemble a fully functional system.},

   abstract = {The Gram-negative Caulobacter crescentus exports RsaA, the crystalline S-layer subunit protein using a dedicated type I secretion system. The protein and two transporter genes (rsaADE) are located together, comparable to the Escherichia coli type I hemolysin hlyCABD operon, where read through of a stem loop following hlyCA results in reduced transcription of the hlyBD. Using two genetic approaches and a direct assessment of transcription from regions 5' to the genes we learned that rsaD and rsaE were transcribed together as a separate transcript from rsaA. These results are contrary to previous assumptions about the rsaADE type I secretion gene control and add another theme to the area of type I secretion transcription regulation. It may be that to accommodate the high levels of RsaA secretion, the type I transporters must be transcribed independently from rsaA.},

   abstract = {The surface layers (S layers) of those bacteria and archaea that elaborate these crystalline structures have been studied for 40 years. However, most structural analysis has been based on electron microscopy of negatively stained S-layer fragments separated from cells, which can introduce staining artifacts and allow rearrangement of structures prone to self-assemble. We present a quantitative analysis of the structure and organization of the S layer on intact growing cells of the Gram-negative bacterium Caulobacter crescentus using cryo-electron tomography (CET) and statistical image processing. Instead of the expected long-range order, we observed different regions with hexagonally organized subunits exhibiting short-range order and a broad distribution of periodicities. Also, areas of stacked double layers were found, and these increased in extent when the S-layer protein (RsaA) expression level was elevated by addition of multiple rsaA copies. Finally, we combined high-resolution amino acid residue-specific Nanogold labeling and subtomogram averaging of CET volumes to improve our understanding of the correlation between the linear protein sequence and the structure at the 2-nm level of resolution that is presently available. The results support the view that the U-shaped RsaA monomer predicted from negative-stain tomography proceeds from the N terminus at one vertex, corresponding to the axis of 3-fold symmetry, to the C terminus at the opposite vertex, which forms the prominent 6-fold symmetry axis. Such information will help future efforts to analyze subunit interactions and guide selection of internal sites for display of heterologous protein segments.},

   abstract = {The dimorphic bacterium Caulobacter crescentus has evolved marked phenotypic changes during its 50-year history of culture in the laboratory environment, providing an excellent system for the study of natural selection and phenotypic microevolution in prokaryotes. Combining whole-genome sequencing with classical molecular genetic tools, we have comprehensively mapped a set of polymorphisms underlying multiple derived phenotypes, several of which arose independently in separate strain lineages. The genetic basis of phenotypic differences in growth rate, mucoidy, adhesion, sedimentation, phage susceptibility, and stationary-phase survival between C. crescentus strain CB15 and its derivative NA1000 is determined by coding, regulatory, and insertion/deletion polymorphisms at five chromosomal loci. This study evidences multiple genetic mechanisms of bacterial evolution as driven by selection for growth and survival in a new selective environment and identifies a common polymorphic locus, zwf, between lab-adapted C. crescentus and clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa that have adapted to a human host during chronic infection.},

   abstract = {P>In bacteria, cytokinesis is dependent on lytic enzymes that facilitate remodelling of the cell wall during constriction. In this work, we identify a thus far uncharacterized periplasmic protein, DipM, that is required for cell division and polarity in Caulobacter crescentus. DipM is composed of four peptidoglycan binding (LysM) domains and a C-terminal lysostaphin-like (LytM) peptidase domain. It binds to isolated murein sacculi in vitro, and is recruited to the site of constriction through interaction with the cell division protein FtsN. Mutational analyses showed that the LysM domains are necessary and sufficient for localization of DipM, while its peptidase domain is essential for function. Consistent with a role in cell wall hydrolysis, DipM was found to interact with purified murein sacculi in vitro and to induce cell lysis upon overproduction. Its inactivation causes severe defects in outer membrane invagination, resulting in a significant delay between cytoplasmic compartmentalization and final separation of the daughter cells. Overall, these findings indicate that DipM is a periplasmic component of the C. crescentus divisome that facilitates remodelling of the peptidoglycan layer and, thus, coordinated constriction of the cell envelope during the division process.},

   abstract = {The HIV/AIDS pandemic remains an enormous global health concern. Despite effective prevention options, 2.6 million new infections occur annually, with women in developing countries accounting for more than half of these infections. New prevention strategies that can be used by women are urgently needed. Topical microbicides specific for HIV-1 represent a promising prevention strategy. Conceptually, using harmless bacteria to display peptides or proteins capable of blocking entry provides an inexpensive approach to microbicide development. To avoid the potential pitfalls of engineering commensal bacteria, our strategy is to genetically display infection inhibitors on a non-native bacterium and rely on topical application of stabilized bacteria before potential virus exposure. Due to the high density cell-surface display capabilities and the inherent low toxicity of the bacterium, the S-layer mediated protein display capabilities of the non-pathogenic bacterium Caulobacter crescentus has been exploited for this approach. We have demonstrated that C. crescentus displaying MIP1alpha or CD4 interfered with the virus entry pathway and provided significant protection from HIV-1 pseudovirus representing clade B in a standard single cycle infection assay. Here we have expanded our C. crescentus based microbicide approach with additional and diverse classes of natural and synthetic inhibitors of the HIV-1 entry pathway. All display constructs provided variable but significant protection from HIV-1 infection; some with protection as high as 70%. Further, we describe protection from infection with additional viral clades. These findings indicate the significant potential for engineering C. crescentus to be an effective and readily adaptable HIV-1 microbicide platform.},
