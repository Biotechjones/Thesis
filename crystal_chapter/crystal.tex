\section{Introduction} % (fold)
\label{sec:crystal_introduction} 

\lettrine[lines=2]{P}{rotein surface layers} (\acs{S-layer}) are para-crystalline coatings that
surround microbial cells\upcite[.]{beveridge1997v}
 They have various functions, such as adhesion
and immune evasion in pathogenic bacteria\upcite[;]{DallaireDufresne20141, kern2010bsla}
 protection against phage and predation\upcite[;]{koval1991effect, koval1993predation}
 and as a pseudo-membrane in archeae\upcite[.]{Blaurock01101976}
 \acp{S-layer} are composed of either one or a small number of secreted proteins that self assemble
into a contiguous sheet in the extracellular environment. Despite their
unique features, \acp{S-layer} have not enjoyed the intensive structural
investigations that most other protein families have received, in no
small part due to their proclivity to self-assemble into large polymeric
structures that resist crystallization.

The Gram-negative bacterium \ac{caulobacter} possesses an
\ac{S-layer} that is composed from thousands of copies of a single 98.6 kDa protein, RsaA\upcite[.]{smit1981periodic}
 This particular \ac{S-layer} has been pursued as a potent platform for peptide display and
protein expression\upcite[.]{smit2008heads}
RsaA is secreted from the cell via a type 1
secretion system\upcite[.]{walker94}
 RsaA shares little to no sequence similarity to any
other known protein, except for in the conserved \ac{rtx}
motifs canonically found in all type 1 secreted proteins\upcite[.]{chenal2009rtx, bingle2000secretion}
 RsaA further isolates itself in its sequence by featuring a uniquely limited amino
acid composition that is biased towards small, simple residues. This bias
towards `cheaper' amino acids is thought to be an evolutionary strategy
for secreted proteins conserved across micobial life and especially in
\ac{caulobacter}\upcite[.]{smith2010economical}

All crystallographic studies of \ac{S-layer} proteins have to inhibit \ac{S-layer} formation. In the
past co-crystallization with nanobodies\upcite[]{baranova2012sbsb}
 and truncation\upcite[]{Pavkov20081226}
 approaches have resulted in monodisperse, crystallizable proteins. Here we describe the
expression of a 804 \ac{aa} C-terminal fragment of RsaA (RsaA \del 0--222) from
its native host, \ac{caulobacter}. The untagged protein was purified
from culture supernate and crystallized by hanging-drop vapour
diffusion. Crystals were grown that diffracted to 2.0 \AA.
Diffraction data were collected at both the \ac{cls} 
and the \ac{ssrl}. RsaA is the first Gram-negative \ac{S-layer} protein to be crystallized.

Crystallization and X-ray diffraction are the two essential first steps of any crystallization project but the next hurdle of solving the phasing problem is an equally crucial and fundamental problem in crystallography. Solving the phases is the hurdle that this project has stumbled on the most. The unique aspects of RsaA preclude it from solution through molecular replacement. A multitude of \ac{MAD} and \ac{SAD} strategies were pursued but without any success. The protein sequence of RsaA was improved through the installation of a decapeptide sequence, in the hope that it would give the protein better ion-binding potential. No solution has solved the problem to date and the atomic structure of RsaA is still undetermined.

\section{Methods}
\label{sec:crystal-materials-and-methods}

\subsection{Strain and plasmid construction}\label{sec:stra-plasm-constr}

\paragraph{Expression strain} The strain used to produce protein was JS4032\upcite[.]{lau2010analysis} 
This strain can also be labeled \caulobacter{} CB2A \textit{$\Delta$sapA $\Delta$manB ::repABC}. The strain's genomic copy of \textit{rsaA} is inactivated by a non-sense frame-shift mutation at the 353$^{rd}$ codon. The gene \textit{sapA} has also been removed, it encodes for the S-layer associated protease that has been implicated in degrading modified versions of RsaA\upcite[.]{sap} The surface polysaccharides, \ac{EPS}, polyrhamnan, and \ac{OPS}, were all eliminated by disrupting the gene \textit{manB}. \textit{manB} encodes for phosphomannomutase, an important enzyme in the bio-synthesis of many deoxysugars (see \cref{ch:lps} for our investigation on the structure of the \ac{LPS}). Removing these carbohydrate structures causes RsaA to no longer associate with the cell surface and it aids in downstream processing, giving the cells favorable centrifugability. The operon repABC has also been knocked into this strain to allow for the maintanance of small expression plasmids\upcite[.]{umelo2001development}

\paragraph{Expression vectors} The plasmid used initially in this study, pUC8CVX-RsaA \del{}0--222, was a construct of the plasmid pUC8CVX\upcite[]{nomellini2007s} containing an open-reading frame encoding for the C-terminal 804 AA of RsaA. pUC8CVX, digested with \textit{Bam}HI and \textit{Hin}DIII, was ligated to the 2819 bp fragment from a similarly digested plasmid containing an open-reading frame encoding for RsaA with a \textit{Bam}HI  endonuclease recognition sequence at the 666 bp position created in a previous study\upcite[.]{ford2007s} The plasmid, pUC8CVX-RsaA \del{} 0--222, was then electroporated\upcite[]{gilchrist1991transformation} into the expression strain. The annotated sequence of RsaA is found in the appendix on \cpageref{app:rsaseq}.

The plasmid that was used to produce RsaA \del 0--222 GSCC723, pUC8CVX-RsaA \del{}0--222 GSCC723 was produced by replacing the the rear portion of RsaA \del 0--222 in pUC8CVX-RsaA \del 0--222 is a preexisting engineered RsaA fragment with an in-frame insertion of the C-Myc-tag antigen at the 723$^{rd}$ codon\upcite[.]{nomellini2007s} This replacement was done by swapping 2630 bp \textit{Bst}XI--\textit{Hin}DIII fragments. The C-Myc-tag is a decapeptide, \texttt{EQKLISEEDL}, that was derived from the oncogenic human protein Myc, in RsaA we hoped that the added charges would improve the proteins ability to grab useful ions. Our `GSCC' cassette contains the C-myc-tag and a few other restriction sites for future cloning endeavours, specifically a \textit{Bgl}II site and a \textit{Pst}I. The translated peptide sequence of the GSCC cassette is \texttt{GSRSVNNASEQKLISEEDLRPSADGS}. 

\subsection{Protein production}
\label{sub:crystal-protein-production}

% I need to have strain stuff here.
Our protein construct, RsaA \del 0--222, was expressed in both a traditional
\ac{ecoli} expression system and our lab's \ac{caulobacter}
protein system\upcite[.]{bingle1997expression, UmeloNjaka20011406, Bingle1990143}
 All attempts to produce protein in \ac{ecoli}
resulted in highly insoluble inclusion bodies that resisted
refolding. Expression levels of RsaA in its native host is notably high\upcite[]{lau2010analysis} but
the system did not initially produce protein in an appropriate form.

The reasons for an N-terminal truncation of RsaA are two-fold; deletion
of the N-terminus produces protein that no longer anchors itself to
outer membrane, resulting in soluble supernatant protein; and the
N-terminus has been identified as the center of three-fold symmetry, its
deletion should prevent wide-scale \ac{S-layer} formation and aggregation.

The cells were grown in HIGGM16 medium\upcite[]{smitpilin81}
at 30\cel for 72 hours. 250 \millilitre cultures
were used in 2500 \millilitre wide-bottom fernbach flasks, resulting in shallow
cultures that did not require shaking for sufficient airation as
agitation of the culture led to macroaggregation of the secreted
protein. The cultures were centrifuged at 6300 rpm in JA-10 bottles for
35 min, the supernates were recovered and recentrifuged. The
supernatants were then filtered through a 0.22 \si{\micro\meter} microfilter to ensure
no cells remained. The protein-containing supernatant was initially
concentrated by lyophilization and rehydration to 1/10 the original
volume. The rehydrated protein solution was dialyzed against distilled
water and microfilitered. Purification was performed over a 26/60 S100
Sephadex size-exclusion chromatography column and mobile phase of 200 \si{\milli\molar} \ce{NaCl} and 10 \si{\milli\molar}
Tris pH 7.5. The first major elution peak was pooled and dialyzed
against distilled water and concentrated by placing the dialysis bags on
super-high molecular weight \ac{peg}. The protein
solution was slowly concentrated to a final concentration of 3.5--4
\mgperml.

\subsection{Crystallization of RsaA \del 0--222}\label{crystallization}

Initial sparse-matrix screening was performed using our protein at a
concentration of 9 \mgperml and JGSC Core I, II, III and IV screens. % Cut it out? Ask Murphy lab
 After one week incubation at room temperature, small crystalline shapes were
observed in JGSC Core I well 28 (200 \si{\milli\molar}  \ce{MgCl2}, 100 \si{\milli\molar} Tris pH 7, 20\% \ac{peg}
8000). These crystals were not reproducible in hanging drop vapor
diffusion wells. Very thin plates readily formed once the concentration
of the protein and the \ac{peg} 8000 were both reduced. Improved crystals
formed when \ce{MgCl2} was replaced with \ce{CaCl2}, \ce{SrCl2}, or \ce{BaCl2}; \ce{SrCl2} was
deemed the most succesful at producing crystals. Final crystallization
conditions were 8.5\% \ac{peg} 8000, 100 \si{\milli\molar} Tris pH 7.4, and 150 \si{\milli\molar} \ce{SrCl2}.
Two crystals forms were observed, planar `plate' crystals and hexegonal
`pencil' crystals. Occasionally the `plate' crystals would grow in clusters where it was advantageous to break off a section of the cluster for diffraction (like the crystal in \cref{fig:crystal-flower}). The `pencil' crystals always formed as individual crystals.

 25\% glycerol was used as a cryo-protectant for all
crystals prior to flash freezing in liquid nitrogen or a cryo-nitrogen stream.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Crystallization of RsaA \del{}0--222 GSCC723} \label{sec:cryst-rsaa-del0}

RsaA \del 0--222 GSCC723 readily crystallized in the successful conditions used for RsaA \del 0--222. The crystals that formed had a different morphology. The crystals looked dendritic, like trees or snowflakes. Extensive optimizations were performed to improve the shape and size of the crystals but no improved conditions could be found. The final conditions used were 9\% \ac{peg}, 100 \millimolar{} tris pH 7.4, and 150 \millimolar{} \ce{SrCl2}. The protein concentration was 3.5 \mgperml{}, 6 \microlitre{} of protein solution was mixed with 3 \microlitre{} of mother liquor. 

A few of the dendritic crystal clusters had branches that were clean, individual crystals. In those cases, the crystal branches were gently broken off of the main cluster and used for X-ray diffraction.


\subsection{Data Collection}\label{sec:crystal-data-collection}
X-ray diffraction data was collected, multiple times, at two synchotron light sources, the \ac{cls} in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan and \ac{ssrl} at Stanford University, California. Both facilities proved suitable for our data collection needs. The beamlines at \ac{cls} offered a slightly larger spectrum of available X-ray wavelengths; some of the high energy wavelengths proved useful for accessing the K-edges of strontium (0.7699 \AA) and bromine (0.9202 \AA). For our best diffracting crystal, diffraction was performed at the `CMCF 08ID-1' beamline at \ac{cls}. A wavelength of 1.54 \AA (equal to the copper K-edge) was used to maximize anomalous signal from iodine. Data was collected through a full 360$\circ$ of rotation, due the low symmetry found in the `plate' crystals. As reference, \cref{fig:edges} shows theoretical anomalous scattering coefficients for most of the elements used in this study.

\section{Results}\label{sec:crystal-results}

\subsection{Initial crystallization and optimization}\label{sec:init-cryst-optim} 
 Attempts to crystallize RsaA \del 0--222 started with the pre-assembled crystallization screens JCGS (Joint Center for Structural Genomics) Core I, II, III, and IV (Qiagen). Higher protein concentrations were sought because we believed that higher protein concentrations would lead to better results and literature sources recommended protein concentration ranges centering on 10 \mgperml\upcite[.]{jancarik1991sparse} Our protein, RsaA \del 0--222 would readily concentrate to 5--7 \mgperml, but when concentrated beyond 7--9 \mgperml aggregation began to occur, both macroaggregation (visible) and microaggregation (monitored by dynamic light scattering). Initial screens were assembled at 9 \mgperml, small crystalline shapes were observed after one week at room temperature. Those first crystals grew in JCGS Core I, well 28 with conditions of 20\% \ac{peg} 8000, 200 \millimolar \ce{MgCl2}, and 100 \millimolar Tris pH 7.
 
The first attempts to transfer from a sitting-drop strategy, as used in initial screening, to a hanging-drop strategy, to be used in optimization, were unsuccessful due to widespread protein precipitation/aggregation. Shifting our divalent cation from \ce{Mg^2+} to \ce{Ca^2+} led to small crystals in our drops. Crystals that were grown \ce{Ca^2+} were incredibly thin, but sizable ($>$0.5 \si{\milli\meter}) in the other two dimensions. The biggest improvements came from shifting the cation again to \ce{Sr^2+} and lowering the concentrations of the protein and precipitants. Due to low protein concentrations, larger drop sizes (6--10 \microlitre) were utilized and larger ratios between protein and mother liquor were (1.5:1--3:1) used so that initial conditions wouldn't cause protein precipitation but protein concentrations would eventually get high enough to be supersaturated. Fine tuning of protein concentration and drop ratios were mostly used to optimize nucleations in the drops. RsaA \del 0--222 always nucleated well, leading to more drops full of small crystals than clear drops with no crystals. A protein concentration in the range of 3.5--4.5 \mgperml, mixed in a ratio of 1.5:1 with mother liquor, had the best results, averaging around 3 nucleations per drop. Further optimization to the crystallization conditions, such as lowering salt concentration (200 \millimolar to 150 \millimolar) and raising the pH (7 to 7.4), were of arguable efficacy. 

\subsection{Properties of the RsaA \del 0--222 crystals}\label{sec:properties-crystals}
Our first diffracting crystals RsaA \del 0--222 were `plate' crystals having a rhomboid shape.  \Cref{fig:crystal-panel} shows examples of these rhomboid crystals. The proportional dimensions of the crystals roughly match the relative dimensions of the crystal unit cell (see \Cref{tab:diffractiondata}), although the thickness seemed variable. The crystals grew often as clusters or stacks, which did not aid in diffraction. \Cref{fig:crystal-flower} on \cpageref{fig:crystal-flower} shows one example of how many of these crystal clusters appeared. The rhomboid `plate' crystals were very strong, resisting crushing so well that we were initially worried that they were salt crystals. The `plates' also resisted X-ray induced damage well---often diffracting acceptably after two or three full data collections. 

Later crystallization efforts for RsaA \del 0--222 started to yield crystals that weren't rhomboid, they were hexagonal prisms, like `pencils.' Drops identical to and next to drops producing `plate' crystals would often grow `pencil' crystals. A few drops even produced both `plate' crystals and `pencil' crystals. These `pencil' crystals looked like protein crystals under a polarizing filter on the microscope and they were confirmed to be protein by X-ray diffraction. The `pencil' crystals were very fragile and often broke or cracked under just gentle manipulation. The `pencils' grew as solitary crystals often on in contact with the lower surface of the crystallization drop. \Cref{fig:pencils} shows a few examples of the hexagonal prism crystals of RsaA \del 0--222.

Low pH solutions would readily crack and destroy any RsaA \del 0--222 crystal. Unfortunately, this pH limitation precluded us from using some soaking agents like uranium compounds and higher concentrations of tantalum bromide. The `plate' crystals were generally more stable in soaking conditions with high salt concentrations than the `pencil' crystals. The `pencil' crystals would quickly crack in high concentrations of \ce{KI} and \ce{KBr}.

\subsection{Properties of the RsaA \del 0--222 GSCC723 crystals}\label{sec:properties-rsaa-del}
As mentioned before, the only crystals that were formed when using the RsaA \del 0--222 GSCC723 protein were `dendritic' crystals that resembled trees or snowflakes. \Cref{fig:crystal-dendrites} shows a few examples of these crystals. Most of these crystals were too clustered to be used for diffraction but a few of the clusters had branches that could be removed and used for diffraction. \Cref{fig:nice-trees} shows a few of the dendritic clusters that were broken apart and diffracted. 

The RsaA \del 0--222 GSCC723 crystals had similar properties to the RsaA \del 0--222 `plate' crystals; the GSCC723 crystals were very strong and stable in most soaking conditions. Unfortunately due to the poor diffraction, the GSCC crystals' potential ability to bind more phasing ions was never realized.

\subsection{X-ray diffraction and phasing}\label{sec:x-ray-diffraction}

The biggest issue that we have had to deal with in this crystallography has been the variability of the crystals. The majority of the crystals of RsaA that have been grown have very poor X-ray diffraction. Frustratingly, there was not an effective way to predict which crystal would be  solid performers. Our best results came from a large crystal that was relatively thin---two features that seemed to be important because small crystals did not diffract well and overly thick crystals were plagued with smeared, messy reflections. \Cref{fig:diffraction} shows one frame of data from our best dataset. An interesting aspect of our data, specifically from `plate' and `dendrite' crystals, is the anisotopy we observe in our diffraction. Due to the often poor quality of the data, we would always collect our data through 360$\circ$ which would lead to long collection strategies and increased radiation damage to the crystal. Radiation damage was never too much of an issue though, as the `plate' crystals were incredibly resistant to damage. Table \ref{tab:diffractiondata} gives an overview of our X-ray diffraction data.

        \begin{table}[p]

        \end{table}   
 
 Once we had crystals that diffracted to a suitable extent the final step towards generating an electron density map would be phasing. Molecular replacement strategies failed due to a lack of homologous structures in the Protein Data Bank. The \ac{rtx}  motifs in RsaA provide a tempting region for structural homology, such as the structure in \cref{fig:intro-rtx} (on \cpageref{fig:intro-rtx}). Neither the structures of solved \ac{rtx} motifs as molecular replacement  or the generated Phyre\upcite[]{kelley2015phyre2} structure for RsaA's \ac{rtx} motifs were effective molecular replacement search models. To try and solve the phase problem we turned to the X-ray fluorescence techniques of \ac{MAD} and \ac{SAD}. 

Our main two candidates for \ac{MAD}/\ac{SAD} phasing elements were the halides, iodine and  bromine\upcite[.]{dauter2000novel} These halides were introduced into the crystals by soaking the crystals in \ce{KI} and \ce{KBr}. Iodine does not have an accessible K or L edge but provides a \ac{SAD}  suitable anomalous signal at achievable wavelengths. Refer back to \cref{fig:edges} for the theoretical profiles of anomalous signal. Iodide-soaked `plate' crystals, among the first conditions ever tested, diffracted well and anomalous signal could be detected in their datasets but not enough to allow for densities to be calculated. A great deal of effort went into trying to improve our initial datasets with more of an anomalous component from iodide. Very few subsequent iodide-soaked crystals diffracted at all  and those that did were of low resolution. Bromine has an accessible K$_{a}$ edge at 0.9202 \AA and so it is useful for \ac{MAD}. Unlike iodide, bromide-soaked crystals did not have the high rate of crystals  with no diffraction but like iodide very few bromide-soaked crystals diffracted beyond 4 \AA{}. 

Many other phasing compounds were tested. The lanthanides all provide a strong  anomalous signal and have been successfully used in the past for \ac{SAD}\upcite[.]{baranova2012sbsb} Lanthanum, Lutetium, and Europium were all used as soaking agents but none produced any detectable anomalous dispersion in the resulting datasets. Europium was also successfully used in the mother-liquor of the crystals to be co-crystallized. Unfortuantely, the co-crystallized crystals had no detectable anomalous signal, despite good diffraction. Europium's L$_{1}$ edge is accessible with synchotron radiation (see \cref{fig:edges}), \ac{MAD} fluorescence scans were done to confirm that there was no detectable Europium in the crystals. \Cref{fig:crystal-panel} features a few of the Europium co-crystallized crystals. In the vein of co-crystallization, Strontium and Barium were effective components of the mother liquor, and possibly potent phasing elements, but neither provided an effective solution to the phase problem when tried. More exotic compounds like Tantulum bromide (\ce{Ta6Br12}) and  triiodide were also tried without resulting in the necessary data.

There were only ever a few `dendritic' crystals that were suitable for X-ray diffraction and none of those few diffracted to an extent or in a manner that was conducive to solving the structure of RsaA \del 0--222 GSCC723. One `dendritic' crystal did diffract reliably to 3.5 \AA{} but exhibited multiple overlapping signals, probably due to separate crystals being fused together.  

The `pencil' crystals never diffracted to any significant extent, at most to 6--10 \AA{}. Initial processing of one of the `pencil' diffraction patterns suggested that its space group was P6. A P6 space group has higher symmetry than the P2$_{1}$ space group we observed in our `plate' crystals. We had deep hopes that the higher symmetry would provide better quality data, unfortunately no well performing `pencil' crystals were ever isolated. The only pencil that we did try to perform a complete data collection on quickly lost diffraction due to radiation damage.

\section{Discussion}\label{sec:crystal-discussion}
Our protein construct, RsaA \del 0--222, was expressed our in \caulobacter protein expression system\upcite[.]{bingle1997expression, UmeloNjaka20011406, Bingle1990143} All attempts to produce protein in \ecoli{} resulted in highly insoluble inclusion bodies that resisted refolding (data not shown). Expression levels of RsaA in its native host is notably high\upcite[]{lau2010analysis} but the system did not initially produce protein in an appropriate form. The problem of aggregation persisted in \caulobacter secreted RsaA; the problem was assuaged by the N-terminal deletion construct, RsaA \del 0--222, but was only completely solved when we started to culture the cells without agitation in wide, shallow flasks. Our shallow culture expression system proved successful at producing 130--150 \milligram  of purified, concentrated protein per litre of culture supernate. RsaA is the natural product of \caulobacter but this system could be useful in producing exogenous protein for crystallization by fusion to the required type 1 section signal\upcite[.]{bingle2000secretion}

The reasons for an N-terminal truncation of RsaA are two-fold; deletion of the N-terminus produces protein that no longer anchors itself to outer membrane, resulting in free-secreted supernatant protein and the N-terminus has been identified as the center of three-fold symmetry (Amat et al., 2010), its deletion should prevent wide-scale \ac{S-layer} formation and aggregation. Our strategies resulted in large well-diffracting crystals, any future investigations of \acp{S-layer} proteins, like past studies, will likewise need to solve the issues of \ac{S-layer} formation and aggregation.

Our `plate' crystals diffract to 2.5 \AA{} with unit-cell parameters of  a=210.79 \AA, b=80.74 \AA, c=221.9 \AA,  and $\beta$=117.46 degrees. These crystal unit-cell sizes almost exactly match the 2D unit size of native \ac{S-layer} repeating unit, a hexamer of RsaA monomers\upcite[.]{smit1992s} These results suggest that the unit-cell of our crystals is six copies of RsaA \del 0--222. Our hexagonal columnar crystals have never diffracted to a suitable resolution, but they are promising because they have higher symmetry and that may result in improved datasets. As our protein has no close matches in the structural databases to use for the purposes of molecular replacement, the phase problem has been tackled with iodine derivitization and \ac{SAD} and bromide and \ac{MAD}. Neither of these approaches give us the required anomalous data that we would need for a solution. RsaA does not have many charged amino-acids, even after we installed the GSCC cassette, and that is why the halides have been so strongly pursued; they don't require specific residues for activity\upcite[.]{dauter2000novel}

As of writing this, the crystallography portion of this dissertation is still ongoing. We are so close to completing this effort that it is hard to imagine that a solution does not exist. Early successes may have been a curse, leading us down roads that held no promise. The fact is we have developed techniques to crystallize our \ac{S-layer} protein and that is the most important step in this project. To end this chapter, here is a quote from Alexander McPherson's 2004 review on macromolecular crystallography:\upcite[]{mcpherson2004introduction}

\begin{quote}
 Presently, and in the foreseeable future, the only technique that can yield atomic level structural images of biological macromolecules is X-ray diffraction analysis as applied to single crystals. While other methods may produce important structural and dynamic data, for the purposes described above, only X-ray crystallography is adequate. As its name suggests, application of X-ray crystallography is absolutely dependent on crystals of the macromolecule, and not simply crystals, but crystals of sufficient size and quality to permit accurate data collection. The quality of the final structural image is directly determined by the perfection, size, and physical properties of the crystalline specimen, hence the crystal becomes the keystone element of the entire process, and the ultimate determinant of its success.
